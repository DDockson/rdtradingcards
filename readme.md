# rdtradingcards

rdtradingcards is a bot that allows for a fully fledged trading card game on the Rhythm Doctor Lounge Discord server.

## Installation and usage

First, install [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) by following its readme.

Next, you will want to download this repo, and make a new file in it called "privatestuff.lua". Use the file named "sampleprivatestuff" as a guideline. 

Then, you can run "run.bat" to launch the bot.

I think you also have to make a folder named `savedata` in here in case you get an error that's like `Uncaught exception: error in error handling`.
